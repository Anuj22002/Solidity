# MyToken Smart Contract

This is a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity. The contract implements a basic ERC20 token with the following features:

* Name: "Anuj"
* Symbol: "Aj"
* Total supply: 0 (initially)
* Minting: The mint function allows anyone to create new tokens by specifying the recipient's address and the amount to be minted.
* Burning: The burn function allows token holders to destroy their tokens by specifying the amount to be burned.
## Usage
To use this smart contract, you will need an Ethereum wallet that supports interacting with smart contracts, such as MetaMask or MyEtherWallet. You can deploy the contract to the Ethereum network using a tool like Remix or Truffle. Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using its ABI (Application Binary Interface) and address.
